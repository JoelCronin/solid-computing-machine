# Express.js Note Taker

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-green)

In this project, I was approached to write a set of code that would allow users to save to-do notes, that would persist so that they could come back and use them later. It would need to this through the use of get, post and delete requests made through a custom-built Express.Js back-end. The client also then wanted the application deployed to Heroku.

During this taks I became familiar and comfortbale with new applications such as Express.js and Heroku and found it to be a challenging but rewarding introduction into the creation and deployment of servers.
